## Overview

LovePowerGrid is a NetLogo simulation that models the distribution, storage, and consumption of energy in a grid that utilizes renewable energy sources. The simulation aims to explore the efficiency, sustainability, and resilience of a renewable energy grid. A unique "Love Energy" source is integrated, which generates power based on the happiness index of the simulated population.

## Features

- **Solar Farms**: Generate energy during daylight hours.
- **Wind Turbines**: Generate energy based on wind speed.
- **Hydro Plants**: Generate energy based on water flow.
- **Battery Storage**: Store excess energy for later use.
- **Consumers**: Residential, commercial, and industrial units consuming energy.
- **Love Energy Source**: Generates energy based on the happiness index of the population.
